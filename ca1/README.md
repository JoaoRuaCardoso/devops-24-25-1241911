## Part 1 Version Control With Git

## Introduction Part 1
This report covers the Version Control with Git assignment for the DevOps course. The assignment consists of two sections: Part 1, which focuses on basic version control without branches, and Part 2, which introduces branching for feature development and bug fixes.

## Environment Setup Part 1
First, I created a local copy of the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST application by cloning an existing repository. After that, I set up my own repository to manage the class assignments, ensuring that all progress and modifications were properly tracked using version control.

** Creating My Repository:** Created new folders on my local machine, .gitignore and Readme. Initialized it as a Git repository.
```shell
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911/ca1/part1
touch ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911/ca1/README.md
touch ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911/.gitignore
cd ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911
git init
```
**Linking to GitHub:**
```gitbash
git remote add origin <repository-URL>
```
**First Commit:**
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "added README and .gitignore"
```
**Pushing to Remote:** Finally, I pushed my initial commit to the GitHub repository, officially starting the version history of my assignments in a remote location.
```shell
git push -u origin master
```

## Part 1.1: Development Without Branches

### Goals and Requirements
-   The initial part of the assignment focuses on understanding and utilizing basic version control operations without branching.
-   Tasks include setting up the project environment, making changes directly to the master branch, and committing those changes.
-   A key requirement is to introduce a new feature (e.g., adding a `jobYears` field to an Employee object) and ensuring proper version tagging, starting with an initial version and updating it after adding the new feature.
-   The emphasis is on practicing commits, understanding the commit history, and using tags for versioning.

### Key Developments 
In the first part, all development was done in the master branch. The steps included:

1. **Copy the code of the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST Application into  `CA1`.**

These commands were used to copy the tutorial directory recursively to `CA1` and pom.xml:
```shell
cp -r ~/Desktop/Switch/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/basic ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911/CA1/part1
cp ~/Desktop/Switch/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/pom.xml ~/Desktop/Switch/devops-24-25-1241911/CA1/part1

```
2. **Commit the changes (and push them).**

Once the `CA1` directory was set up with the Tutorial application, I proceeded to commit these changes to the master branch with the following commands:
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "copied the code"
git push
```
3. **Tagging the repository to mark the version of the application.**

Following the versioning pattern outlined in the assignment, major.minor.revision, I tagged the initial setup as `v1.1.0` and subsequently pushed this tag to the remote repository:
```shell
git tag v1.1.0 
git push origin v1.1.0
```
4. **Develop a new feature to add a new field to the application.**

The core task of this first part was to develop a new feature by adding a `jobYears` field to the application, which records the number of years an employee has been with the company. Additionally, were implemented unit tests to ensure the creation of Employees and the validation of their attributes were functioning correctly.
The following files were modified to incorporate this new feature:
- **Employee.java**: This Java class, representing the employee model, was updated to include a new integer field named `jobYears`. The modification involved adding the field itself along with its getter and setter methods to allow for data encapsulation and access and the validation of all parameters. Below are the key additions and modifications made to the `Employee` class to support the new functionality and ensure robust data validation:

```java
public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String description, int jobYears) throws Exception {
  if(!isNameValid(firstName)) throw new Exception("First name cannot be empty");
  this.firstName = firstName;
  if(!isNameValid(lastName)) throw new Exception("Last name cannot be empty");
  this.lastName = lastName;
  if(!isNameValid(description)) throw new Exception("Description cannot be empty");
  this.description = description;
  if(!isJobYearsValid(jobYears)) throw new Exception("Job Years cannot be negative");
  this.jobYears = jobYears;
}
private boolean isNameValid(String text){
  if (text == null || text.isBlank()) return false;
  return true;
}
private boolean isJobYearsValid(int years){
  if (years < 0) return false;
  return true;
}

@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
  if (this == o) return true;
  if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
  Employee employee = (Employee) o;
  return Objects.equals(id, employee.id) &&
          Objects.equals(firstName, employee.firstName) &&
          Objects.equals(lastName, employee.lastName) &&
          Objects.equals(description, employee.description);
}

```
- **EmployeeTest.java**: To ensure the reliability of the new `jobYears` field, this file was updated to include unit tests. Key aspects of the testing include:
  - Validation Tests: Conducted tests to validate that the constructor and setters reject invalid inputs (null or empty Strings and  negative `jobYears`), safeguarding against improper object creation.
  - Positive Scenarios: Confirmed that valid inputs result in successful object creation, with no exceptions thrown, ensuring the `Employee` class functions as intended under correct usage.
  - Equality and Hashing: Verified the correct implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` methods, essential for accurate object comparison.
  - String Representation: Tested the `toString` method to ensure it accurately represents `Employee` object details, facilitating easier debugging and logging.

Here are some examples of the tests implemented:
```java

  @Test
  void shouldCreateEmployee() throws Exception{
    //arrange
    Employee employee = new Employee("Joseph","Green","CEO",10);

            ", description='CEO'" +
            ", jobYears='10'}";
    //act
    String result = employee.toString();
    //assert
    assertEquals(expected,result);
  }

}
```
- **DatabaseLoader.java**: The `DatabaseLoader` class was updated to include `jobYears` for sample `employees`, ensuring the new field is functional from the start. Below is the modified code:
```java
@Override
public void run(String... strings) throws Exception { // <4>
  this.repository.save(new Employee("Frodo", "Baggins", "ring bearer",5));
}
```
- **app.js**: The React components within `app.js` were modified to support the display of the new `jobYears` field within the employee list. The `EmployeeList` and `Employee` components now include a column for "Job Years" in the rendered table, allowing users to view the number of years an employee has been with the company alongside their other details.
  The following code snippet illustrates the changes made to `app.js` to incorporate the `jobYears` field into the application's frontend:
```javascript
class EmployeeList extends React.Component{
  render() {
    const employees = this.props.employees.map(employee =>
            <Employee key={employee._links.self.href} employee={employee}/>
    );
    return (
            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                  <th>jobYears</th>
                </tr>
                {employees}
              </tbody>
            </table>
    )
  }
}
```
```javascript
class Employee extends React.Component{
  render() {
    return (
            <tr>
              <td>{this.props.employee.firstName}</td>
              <td>{this.props.employee.lastName}</td>
              <td>{this.props.employee.description}</td>
              <td>{this.props.employee.jobYears}</td>
            </tr>
    )
  }
}

```

5. **Debug the server and client parts of the solution.**

After verifying the `jobYears` field's integration, I ran the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` to test its real-time functionality at `http://localhost:8080/`. This step ensured smooth feature operation and compatibility. I also reviewed the code to verify `jobYears` handling on both server and client sides.

6. **End of the assignment**

Once satisfied with the stability and performance of the new feature, I committed the changes to the repository with a descriptive message outlining the enhancements. Following this, the updated code was pushed to the remote server to share the advancements with the team and maintain the project's collaborative workflow. To mark this significant update, I tagged the commit with `v1.2.0`, following the semantic versioning pattern adopted for the project.
Create tag ca1-part1.1 as result of the end of the first assignment.

## Part 1.2: Development Using Branches

### Goals and Requirements

- The second part focuses on using branches for features and bug fixes, ensuring isolated development and proper merge strategies.
- It requires creating feature branches to avoid interfering with the main codebase until merging.
- The part ends with tagging the master branch after merges to mark new versions, highlighting effective version control.

### Key Developments

In the second part, branch-based development was used to improve features and fix bugs while keeping the master branch stable for publishing the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST Application.

Since the steps for adding features and fixing bugs are similar to Part 1, the code is not repeated. The key difference is the use of branches. Here are the main steps:

1. **Start using the master branch**

To ensure I was in the correct branch, especially the master branch for stable releases, I used the `git branch` command. This was crucial for verifying my current branch, marked by an asterisk (*) in the output.

2. **Develop new features in branches**

During the development phase of adding an `email field`, branch management was essential. A dedicated `email-field` branch was created to encapsulate all related changes. After switching to this branch, I used the `git branch` command to confirm the switch. The commands used were:
```shell
git branch
git branch email-field
git checkout email-field
git branch
```

3. **Integration and Testing of the Email Field**

The process of adding `email` field support and validation followed a similar approach to the `jobYears` field in Part 1. Here are the key steps:
- **Code Implementation**: Like the previous feature development, I extended the `Employee` class to include an `email` field with getter and setter methods. Data models, forms, and views were updated to integrate the new field into both the frontend and backend.
- **Unit Testing**: Following the established pattern, I wrote comprehensive unit tests to verify the correct creation of Employee instances with the new email field and to enforce validation rules, such as non-null and non-empty values for the email attribute.
- **Debugging**: The server and client were thoroughly debugged to resolve any issues from adding the email field, ensuring smooth operation and a seamless user experience.

4. **Merge the code with the master**

Completing the `email` field feature involved integrating changes into the main branch and updating the version. The finalized changes in `email-field` were committed and pushed. A no-fast-forward merge preserved history, followed by pushing the updates. Finally, the new version was tagged and pushed. The commands used were:
```shell
# Commit the feature changes:
git add .
git commit -m "added email field"

# Push the feature branch upstream:
git push --set-upstream origin email-field

# Switch to the main branch and merge changes:
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff email-field

# Push the merged changes to update the main branch:
git push

# Tag the new version and push the tag:
git tag V1.3.0 
git push origin V1.3.0
```

5. **Create a new branch to fix a bug**

To fix the email validation bug in the `Employee` class, a `fix-invalid-email` branch was created following the usual workflow. Development, testing, and merging followed previous practices, ensuring code integrity and stability.
The bug fix focused on enhancing the `Employee` class with validation logic to ensure the email field contains an "@" sign. The following code snippet illustrates the added validation:

```java
private boolean isEmailValid(String email) {
		return email != null && email.contains("@");
	}
```
6. **End of the assignment**

After implementing and testing the fix, the changes were merged into the master branch, and the version was updated to `V1.3.1` to reflect the minor fix. The repository was then tagged as `ca1-part2` to mark the assignment's completion.

## Final Results

### Implementation
Bellow follows all the new features, the final state of the application is illustrated below:

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/N0DkdGJP/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/9449M2jG)

The initial model included First Name, Last Name, and Description. Development began with Job Title, followed by Job Years in Part 1 of CA1 to track tenure. In Part 2 of CA1, the Email field was added for contact information.

### Branches
The image below reveals the existing branches in the repository, as output by the `git branch` command.

This assignment taught me the value of using branches to isolate changes for specific features or fixes. This approach maintains codebase stability while ensuring a clear and structured change history.

### Tags

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/c4fqBPFP/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/jLqks30h)

Using tags showed me how to mark key points in the project's history, making it easier to track progress and revert to previous versions when needed.

### Issue Tracking

During development, 18 issues were created on GitHub to track and manage problems. These issues were resolved and closed by including fixes #1 to fixes #18 in the commit messages. This practice ensures a clear history of problems and solutions while automatically closing issues when commits are pushed. Below is a visual representation of the issues created and closed during the assignment:

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/x8JXZ9Xv/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/BP3ZL9cb)

Issues serve multiple purposes in a project, such as tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks. They can be assigned, labeled, and linked to commits or pull requests. Moving forward, the goal is to integrate issues throughout development to improve task management, progress tracking, and team collaboration.

## Alternative Solution
In seeking an alternative to Git for version control, Fossil offers a distinct approach with its centralized model, contrasting Git's decentralized nature. This section compares SVN to Git in terms of version control features and describes how SVN could be utilized to achieve the goals set forth in this assignment.

### Comparison of Fossil and Git

# Fossil vs. Git Comparison

The Add a New Task section details extending Gradle‚Äôs functionality, while Add a Unit Test emphasizes integrating tests for project reliability. Lastly, Add a Copy Task and Add a Zip Task demonstrate Gradle‚Äôs role in file handling for project distribution.

The report concludes by summarizing the learning outcomes, challenges faced, and practical skills gained in using Gradle for software development.

## Environment Setup Part 2

The setup began by creating a new directory, /CA2/Part1, and cloning the example application from the provided Bitbucket repository. This repository included a build.gradle file and the Gradle Wrapper, ensuring a consistent environment.

After installing Gradle, I verified the setup by running gradle -v. I then imported the project into my Gradle-supported IDE, leveraging its built-in tools. To confirm the configuration, I executed a basic Gradle build, ensuring all components were correctly set up.

These steps provided a solid foundation for the subsequent tasks in the assignment.

## Gradle Basic Demo 

The Gradle Basic Demo was a hands-on exercise in managing a multithreaded chat server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously.

**Gradle Build Process:**

To set up the demo, I ran `./gradlew` build in the project's root directory. This command compiled the code and generated an executable .jar file. The screenshot below verifies the successful build.

**Server Launch:**

Following that, I launched the chat server using the command java `-cp build/libs/basic_demo-0.1.0.jar basic_demo.ChatServerApp 59001`. The screenshot below shows the server running and awaiting client connections.

For the client side, I established connections to the chat server by executing `/gradlew runClient`, ensuring each client connected to localhost on port 59001. The build.gradle file was configured to allow easy modifications for different connection settings. To demonstrate the server's capability to manage multiple clients, I launched several client instances from different terminals. The screenshots below show the active chat sessions, highlighting the multi-client functionality in action.

## Adding a runServer Task for Simplified Server Startup

I added a `runServer` task to the `build.gradle` file to streamline the server startup process. This task allows us to launch the chat server directly using a Gradle command, eliminating the need for manual inputs.

The `runServer` task is defined as follows in the `build.gradle` file, with the type set to JavaExec to execute Java applications. It depends on the classes task to ensure the necessary classes are compiled before starting the server, and it launches the ChatServerApp on port 59001:

```java

tasks.register('runServer', JavaExec){
    group = "DevOps"
    description = "Launches a chat Server"

    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath

    mainClass = "basic_demo.ChatServerApp"
    args '59001'
}
```
I tested this task by running `./gradlew runServer` from the command line, and the terminal feedback confirmed the server was successfully launched, as shown in the screenshot below.

This integration into our Gradle build script showcases Gradle's flexibility and enhances productivity by automating routine tasks.

## Add a unit test

I added a unit test to verify the App class‚Äôs functionality. The test, located in `src/test/java/basic_demo/AppTest.java`, checks if the App class returns a non-null greeting message.

To set up the test environment, I included the JUnit dependency in the `build.gradle` file:

```java
testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
```
This ensures that the project can recognize and run JUnit tests smoothly. Below is the content of AppTest.java, which contains the test case:

```java
package basic_demo;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class AppTest {
  @Test public void testAppHasAGreeting() {
    App classUnderTest = new App();
    assertNotNull("app should have a greeting", classUnderTest.getGreeting());
  }
}
```
I executed the test using the command `./gradlew test`. The screenshot below shows the terminal output, confirming the test passed successfully.

## Add a new task of type Copy

The next task involved adding a `Copy` task to the `build.gradle` file, designed to create a backup of the source code. This ensures a reliable recovery point in case of unforeseen issues during development.

The backup task uses Gradle's Copy task type to replicate the contents of the `src` directory into a designated backup location within the project. This step is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date snapshot of the codebase, especially before significant changes or updates:

```java
task backup(type: Copy) {
  group = "DevOps"
  description = "Make a backup of the sources of the Application"

  from 'src'
  into 'backup'
}
```
After implementing the task, I tested its functionality by running `./gradlew backup` from the command line. The task executed successfully, as shown in the terminal output below, confirming that the source code was copied to the backup location and ensuring the task's effectiveness in safeguarding the project‚Äôs code.

## Add a new task of type Zip

The final task involved creating a Zip task to package the project's source code into a compressed .zip file. This task simplifies packaging the src directory, making it easier for backups or distribution. It‚Äôs essential for archiving project iterations or preparing the code for sharing.

Below is the task definition:

```java
task zipSource(type: Zip) {
group = "DevOps"
description = "Zips the source code files"

    from 'src'
    archiveFileName = 'src_archive.zip'
    destinationDir = file('archives')
}
```
After defining the zip task, I executed it with ./gradlew zip. The terminal output confirmed the successful execution, indicating that the src directory was compressed into a ZIP archive. Below is a screenshot of the terminal showing the successful archive creation.
